	<body>
		<p>UsabLog is an experimental usability test observation logging tool. I'm building UsaBlog partly to fill a need I've felt for easy, lightweight usability test logging and partly as a learning exercise for me to improve my coding skills.</p>
		<p><strong>Use UsabLog at your own risk. I make no guarantees or warranties about this tool.</strong></p>
		<p>UsabLog using HTML5 local storage to store logs. That means if you clear your browser history, you will lose your logs. I strongly recommend you copy and paste the log into another format after you log a session.</p>

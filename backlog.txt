Adjust start time to sync properly with video if log not started when video started.
(Suggested by Nate Bolt of Bolt|Peters)

	Option 1	Add "/+ 10:30" and "/- 10:30" commands which would reset start and update 
				all times already written to the log by adding or subtracting ten minutes 
				and 30 seconds.
	Option 2	Add "/adjust 08:32" which would reset start time to 8:32am and rewrite all 
				of the already written times to be relative to that start time.

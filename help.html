			<p>In addition to logging notes, you can use these commands to do a few other things.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>/t {Task Name}</dt>
				<dd>Log the beginning of a new task.</dd>
				<dt>/e {Error Description}</dt>
				<dd>Log an 'error' committed by the participant.</dd>
				<dt>/a {Assistance Description}</dt>
				<dd>Log assistance required of the facilitator by the participant.</dd>
				<dt>/erase</dt>
				<dd>Remove the last log entry. Be warned, though: you erase it, it's gone, and there isn't any confirmation.</dd>
				<dt>/nuke</dt>
				<dd>Blow away all localStorage data. This is useful for returning to a complete state. If you do this, you will lose ALL sessions you've logged, and you won't be able to recover them.</dd>
